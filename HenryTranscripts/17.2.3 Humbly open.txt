Hi. A couple of things that I really admire myself about Jar-Jo is that he spent so long training and was so cautious and perhaps almost reluctant to start teaching. I love the way that even after 40 years of training, when he sets out on this phase of pilgrimage, he says, I'm ready to learn from a seven-year-old child. 

00:25 
Anybody who can teach me, I want it. I'm open to it. So let's see if we can bring this spirit into this sit right now. Coming into a comfortable seated position. What does your body have to teach you right now? 

00:52 
Let it relax. Let yourself soften into your body. Allow your body to soften, to be itself. What might you learn from it right now? Perhaps some aches or pains or energies or tightness or some kind of tone within it. 

01:24 
What do you find? you you If your body wants to adjust in some way, let it do so. Do it mindfully, slowly. Settle into stillness again. What is there you might learn from your body right now? and your mind right now. 

03:47 
How is it doing? What might the state of your mind be teaching right now? What might you learn from your mind, or about your mind, right now? you you you Are you open to a certain kind of humility, to being humble in the face of experience right now? 

06:13 
Letting experience teach you, show you what it is. What's it like to invite a kind of humble openness? Is there resistance to it? Or is it some kind of relief? Can we release our plans and intentions and wishes and just be humble and open? 

08:46 
you you you As we come out of this sit, can we keep whatever we've found by way of openness, staying open as you bring movement back into the body, as you look around, maybe stretch? So see if you can check in with yourself in the course of your day, now and then, and just ask, what would it be like to be humble and open right now? 

10:16 
Have a great rest of your day.
