Welcome to our final sit in this retreat and on this trail. We've been exploring the koans mostly through the life of the great master Jiaozhou, and also in this retreat with a perennial koan. What is this? 

00:18 
Once again, I want to acknowledge that koans are not always easy to sit with and to congratulate you for getting this far and being up for trying them out, but I do believe they have a secret way of working on us, no matter how we feel about them, actually, and we may find in time to come that we sense shifts have happened as a result of having done some koan work.

In this last sit, we're just going to rest with one single syllable, this. So let's come into stillness. Make what adjustments you need to. We might substitute the word rest for stillness, coming into a kind of absolute rest. 

01:24 
We might need to allow the body and mind a little space for winding down, for joining the rest to which they are both invited. Still. Restful. Coming into a condition of great simplicity, coming to rest in just this. 

03:06 
No need to name it, no need to parse it out, simply this. You may already be repeating the little word now and then in your sitting. If not, feel free to try that. This This you you Joining a kind of absolute quiet, this.

coming into a profound rest as if one that's always been here this It can be as if we're joining the world's own deep rest. you you Could it be that somehow there's nothing but this? Let's gently come out of the sit and stay aware in the process.

So looking around, moving the body, coming back into the space you're in. Great. Congratulations on finishing this trail winding through the wild world of Coines. Thank you so much for sticking with it.
