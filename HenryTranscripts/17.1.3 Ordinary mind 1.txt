Welcome back. Continuing with this koan about Zhao Zhou's early training, we're going to pick up the next line in it when he has asked what is the way and his teacher Nan Chuan has answered, ordinary mind is the way. 

00:18 
The 20th century Zen master Yemada Ko-Un said about this, what is ordinary mind? It's our ordinary consciousness, our ordinary everyday life. It's getting up, washing the face, eating breakfast, going to work. 

00:36 
It's seeing the leaves on the trees, the flowers in the field. It's birth, it's death. We do not even have to use the word mind. The ordinary is the way. So now we're going to sit with this phrase, ordinary mind is the way. 

00:57 
Once again, let's come into our comfortable seated meditation posture. Get balanced if your back is unsupported and otherwise really rest into the support being offered. Let yourself surrender to gravity. 

01:27 
Let the whole body soften. And see if the mind is ready to soften in some way as well. Ordinary mind is the way. Ordinary experience is the way. In other words, experience just right now. Hearing is the way. 

03:09 
The sensations of the body are the way. Can we kind of reel in or wind back any impulse to be searching for something else and instead just be as we are with exactly what is arising. you Just being with what is present. 

05:42 
This ordinary experience is the way. Nothing special. The ordinary is the way. Just whatever's happening now. What if just being, just being, exactly like this, is the way? you you you What if your experience, just as it is, is the way? 

09:15 
What if just this is the way? Gently bringing ourselves out of the meditation, raising the eyes, looking around, moving the body. Once again, we're exploring the use of koans as a means of support for our practice. 

10:46 
Next up, we're going to delve a little deeper into this term, the way. Have a great rest of your day.
