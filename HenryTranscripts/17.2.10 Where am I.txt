Welcome back. In this session, I thought we might just sit with the question, where am I? In the spirit of the pilgrimage that Zhao Zhou has been on in this phase of his life that's lasted 20 years, we could ask ourselves the question, where are we going? 

00:20 
Where actually are we right now? Of course, we might have immediate answers, you know, I'm in a certain room in such and such a building, or whatever, but there's a deeper question here. Where is all of this? 

00:33 
Where actually is all this experience arising? Not only that, another implication in the question, where am I is? Where is this sense of I, this sense of me? Where actually is it? Can I really find it? 

00:51 
So let's see how it is to sit with this question, basically, where. Coming into a comfortable seated position, right here, right where you are. you letting your body rest into stillness and letting an awareness that's ampler and perhaps quieter, more peaceful, emerge from stillness. 

01:42 
And once again, let's see if we can just sit with a question without striving to answer it, just let it infuse and inform the experience of sitting still. Where am I? Where am I? you Resting with the question, being with the question itself, where am I? 

04:16 
This sense of myself that seems to arise, where is it, where exactly is it? Where is this I? Where is this me? We might sense the place around us, the environment around us. Where is this? Where is all this? 

07:42 
House, street, town, district, region, nation, world, solar system, where is all this? Where am I? Let's stay aware as we come out of the sit, bringing movement into the upper body, moving the feet, moving the hands, looking around. 

10:14 
Great. I invite you to ask this question we've just been sitting with, where am I at any point during your day? Wishing you a great rest of your day.
