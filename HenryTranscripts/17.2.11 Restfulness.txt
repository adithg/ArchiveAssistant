Welcome. So after quite a fair amount of somewhat hard work with the Koans at the cold face of consciousness, I think we've earned a good rest in this last session on the retreat. And let's have a sit now where we don't do much of anything. 

00:21 
No Koan, nothing to work with, nothing to work on, just allowing ourselves to expand into restfulness. So let's get comfortable, get yourself settled however you'd like right now. Imagine that your body is a rag doll. 

00:54 
Let it just hang. Let it be completely loose. Allow it to be soft. Let the tongue rest. Let the face rest. Their shoulders and arms rest. Let hips and legs rest. And let the entire torso, back and front, chest and belly be warm and soft at rest. 

01:46 
And just be with experience as you rest. you Can you allow yourself a little time of rest? What's it like to be a bit more restful? Is there a way you could rest deeper into restfulness? Is it possible you could let the entire system, body, mind, heart, simply give way? 

05:22 
Give in. Drop everything. Not trying for anything. Just being. Just resting. Enjoying a quiet body, a quiet mind, a settled heart. Resting in your very own being and gently bringing ourselves out of the meditation, bringing movement back into the body, gazing around you, taking a deeper inhale and an exhale.

Great. Congratulations. We finished another retreat on co-ent. Of course, I understand that sometimes they're frustrating or baffling and we don't seem to be getting anywhere, but co-ent are actually turning things over within us, whether we recognize it or not, and that's all to the good in the long run.

Next up, we'll be diving into Zhao Zhou's formal teaching life, the last chapter in his very long lifetime. Have a great rest of your day.
