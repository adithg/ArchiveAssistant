Welcome back. We're going to have another meditation now on absence but looking at a different side of it. In our last session we were exploring whether there might be a way that our field of experience is a kind of absence. 

00:19 
In this one we're going to explore whether our own presence to experience might also be a kind of absence. So let's get set up for meditation. Arrange yourself physically as you'd like to and start to become present. 

00:49 
And just notice what that means for you. Perhaps becoming still so it's easier to notice just being here. Perhaps starting to taste a different complexion or shade of awareness. One that's quieter and more open. 

01:29 
What exactly is it to be present? What is our presence? Thank you. Could it be that being present is nothing but being open, open with nothing in the way, wide open? When we're really present in the state of presence, is there really anything here? 

04:05 
Or is it just an empty openness? Could it be the true... presence shows up when we are somehow absent. Thank you. What if our deepest presence is actually an absence? Could it be that true presence appears when we're not here, when we're absent? 

08:15 
Thank you. Might the fullest presence really be absence? Thank you. Thank you. Can we rest in absence? Let's bring some gentle movement back into the body. Coming out of the meditation, looking around, returning to the space you're in, great.

I think that the work we've done on presence in the course of this trail has really brought us to the point where we can do this kind of exploration. What is really here, what is experience, and what is our awareness, our presence? 

11:28 
Definitely, I know these kinds of invitation can seem quite abstract or recondite or hard to grasp, and that's just fine. We will be circling back and exploring these matters as we continue on the pathway. 

11:44 
Have a great rest of your day.
