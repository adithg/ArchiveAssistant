Hello and welcome back. In this session we're going to adapt the question that we've been sitting with, the ancient koan, what is this? Let's start right away. So come into a comfortable seated position, get settled, adjust your body as you need to, and then let's relax the jaw and relax the shoulders. 

00:37 
Arms and hands, let them become limp. Let the whole trunk be soft, chest and belly becoming soft, and let the legs also be loose and soft. So the whole body is soft and still, allowing the body to find its way to a deep stillness.

What's it like to be still? What do you sense in stillness? you When we're really still, we might sense the body more clearly. We also might detect the soundscape more precisely. What's it like? Stillness. 

03:57 
What's it like now being still? How is the body in this stillness? What's it like this stillness? We keep checking in with stillness and what it's like. We can also ask, what is stillness? As an experience, what is stillness? 

05:37 
you If stillness somehow clarifies our awareness, our capacity to be aware, what is it that is aware, what is awareness? What is it that's aware of stillness? What is this still awareness? What is this restful awareness? 

09:09 
What is rest? What is this? Let's now invite movement back into the body and remain aware as we do so. Raise the eyes, look around, see that we can actually stay fully present and aware as we do. We've been exploring some of the relationship between stillness and awareness and applying our koan question to them both. 

10:53 
In the next sit we'll pick up a new primordial koan. Have a great rest of your day.
