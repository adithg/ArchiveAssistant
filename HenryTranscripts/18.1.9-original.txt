Hi. In the final session of this retreat, we're going to have a rather restful meditation, just gently inviting ourselves into a quality of kindness, of patience, and of welcoming that is, I believe, intrinsic to awareness itself. 

00:25 
So let's start by becoming still and getting comfortable, and letting everything go. Whatever's come just before now, you're allowed to let it go. And whatever may come after, let it be blank. All there is right now is here, just this, stillness, and quiet.

Allow yourself to rest. you you you Right now, nothing need be different. If you're noticing little impulses toward things you might feel you need to do, or to figuring something out, or to not having certain sensations be present, let all those impulses be just as they are.

You don't have to change them. Allow them. What about if meditation is really the great allowing? It truly allows whatever we experience during the period of meditation. And that is the heart of it. Allowing. 

05:02 
If any sense that things need to be different arises, just hand it over to your meditation and let meditation allow it. you Any wisps of stress or unease Meditation allows them Welcomes them Embraces them it's as if, as the great allowing is going on, all we do is dissolve into an innate rest.

Nothing to do, pure allowing, and rest. you you you Gently bringing some movement back into the body, as we do so, can we actually stay with a quality of restfulness and of a kind of universal allowing?

Congratulations on finishing another retreat on the way. This has been a solid first step towards original love, towards getting to know the boundless, nameless, oneness, emptiness of our original nature.

which is filled with love. We'll be stepping still closer to it in the next retreat. Have a great rest of your day.
